        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Originally, Vander was a former member of the brutal Zaunite gang called the "Firelights" before he sought to create a better, more peaceful life for himself and the people of Zaun. After a violent past, he became a stabilizing force in the undercity, running a bar, and attempting to keep the peace in a fractured world.</p>
        <p>Vander’s complex relationship with his children, particularly Vi and Powder, is central to his character arc. After a series of events that lead to the tragic loss of his own family, Vander becomes a father figure to Vi and Powder, taking them in and providing them with the safety and care they need. However, his efforts to protect them are constantly challenged by the darker forces of Zaun, particularly the ruthless Silco.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Vander's legacy is one of selflessness and sacrifice.

His death marks a pivotal moment in the *Arcane* series, deeply affecting both Vi and Powder's transformations into the characters they eventually become.</p>
